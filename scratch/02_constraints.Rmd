# Constraints

There are only a few constraints (R calls them "contrasts") to know:


## `contr.treatment`
The default. Sets a level of the factor to have zero effect. You saw an example of the design matrix just a moment ago. Take a look at the design matrix according to R:

```{r}
# look at the default coding of feed
contrasts( chickwts$feed )
```


## "One-hot" encoding
You can do this yourself by removing the intercept. You gain interpretability, but now the significance level is telling you whether the factor level mean is different from zero (you usually want to know if it is different from average).

```{r}
# fit a version of the model for chick weight that has no intercept
lm_nointercept = lm( weight ~ feed - 1, data=chickwts )
summary( lm_nointercept )
```

## `contr.sum`: sum-to-zero constraints
With sum-to-zero constraint, the factor level effects must add up to zero. Thus, the intercept represents the average of the fitted factor effects, and the final level is calculated by adding together all of the shown estimates.

You can set the contrasts as an attribute of the data or pass it to the `lm()` function.


```{r}
# set the feed variable to use sum-to-zero constraint
contrasts( chickwts$feed ) = contr.sum
chickwts$feed

# re-fit the linear model 
lm_stz = lm(weight ~ feed, data=chickwts)
summary( lm_stz )

# calculate the missing coefficient
sum( coef(lm_stz)[[1]] - sum( coef(lm_stz)[2:6]) )
```

## `contr.poly`
This one is for ordered factors, and gets a bit more complicated. Beyond today's scope.

## `contr.helmert` and `contr.SAS`
Used in special situations that I wont get into, but you can infer their workings by looking at how they set up the design matrix for our example:

```{r}
# set the helmert contrast and look at its design
contrasts( chickwts$feed ) = contr.helmert
chickwts$feed
```

```{r}
# set feed to use the SAS contrast and look at its design
contrasts( chickwts$feed ) = contr.SAS
chickwts$feed
```
